The Compassionate Path community<span class='marginnote'>Our Lineage from top to bottom: Rev. Dr. Daiho Hilbert Roshi, Rev. Ken Hogaku McGuire Roshi, and Rev. Dr. Soyu Zengaku Matsuoka Roshi </span> is <span class='marginnote'><img class="fullwidth" src="/img/daiho.png"></span>  affiliated with *The Order of Clear Mind Zen* founded in 2005 by Rev. Dr. Harvey Daiho Hilbert Roshi. Clear Mind Zen is an Engaged Buddhist training and practice order  in the lineage of Rev. Dr. Soyu Zengaku Matsuoka Roshi. The goal of the order is to bring about abundant good for all beings through social action. Daiho Roshi says that Zen is not about detaching oneself from the world, "It's about engaging the world in a way that will benefit all beings." Daiho is a practioner of street Zen where one meditates in public spaces to bear witness to the joy and suffering in the world. The picture of him on the right is at the Vietnam War Memorial in Las Cruces. Here is [a very short video of him sitting there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQIWfBHkrrg).
